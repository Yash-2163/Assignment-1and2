# Git and GitHub Assignment 1 & 2:

This file shows how I did the Git and GitHub assignment.

## Assignment 1: Basic Git Workflow

**Goal:** Learn the basic Git commands.

**What I did:**

1.  **Started a Git project:**
    -   Used `git init` to make the project ready for Git.

2.  **Made a text file:**
    -   Created `simple.txt` with 5-10 lines.
3.  **Saved the file in Git for the first time:**
    -   `git add simple.txt` (to prepare the file)
    -   `git commit -m "initial commit"` (to save it with a message)

4.  **Made three changes and saved each one:**

5.  **Looked at the history:**
    -   Used `git log --oneline --graph` to see all the saves I made.

6.  **Checked the differences:**
    -   Used `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` to see what changed between two saves.

7.  **ScreenShots:**

## Assignment 2: GitHub Basics & Collaboration

**Goal:** Learn how to use GitHub for basic teamwork.

**What I did:**

1.  **Got a GitHub account:**
    -   My account is at [https://github.com/yash-2163](https://github.com/yash-2163).

2.  **Put my local project on GitHub:**
    -   `git remote add origin https://github.com/Yash-2163/Assignment-1and2` (linked my project to GitHub)
    -   `git branch -M main` (renamed the main part of my project)
    -   `git push -u origin main` (sent my project to GitHub)

3.  **Made a `README.md` file on GitHub:**
    -   Used the GitHub website to create a basic `README.md` file.

4.  **Got the changes from GitHub to my computer:**

5.  **Created a new section to update the `README.md`:**

6.  **Changed the `README.md` and saved it:**

7.  **Asked to merge my changes:**
    -   Created a "pull request" on GitHub to merge `feature/update-readme` into `main`.

8.  **Approved and merged the changes:**
    -   Reviewed my changes on GitHub and then merged them.
